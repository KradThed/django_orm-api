Django API Project Setup
This project aims to set up a Django application with an API and utilize Django ORM for database management. We'll configure Django REST Framework (DRF), create serializers for data conversion, implement views, and set up routes to handle requests efficiently. The project will also include features such as filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination.
